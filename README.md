# TwitterLegacyPatcher
tweak to force older twitter for iOS versions to work again.

Tested on twitter v7.29.1, v8.58, v8.71

## Known issues
1) currently on 8.58 (and presumably other 8.x versions) trying to log in will result in an crash. the current workaround seems to be downgrading to 7.29.1, login normally, and then upgrade back to your specified version. 8.71 requires an valid att token to login
2) you cant like tweets or view quote tweets. the profile tweets and replies seems to be an hit or miss.
