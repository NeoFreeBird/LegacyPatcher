# TwitterLegacyPatcher
tweak to force older twitter for iOS versions to work again.

Tested on twitter v7.29.1 and v8.58

## Known issues
1) currently on 8.x versions trying to log in will result in an crash. the current workaround seems to be downgrading to 7.29.1, login normally, and then upgrade back to your specified version.
2) again you cant like tweets or view quote tweets. the profile tweets and replies seems to be an hit or miss.
